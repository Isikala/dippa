% Lines starting with a percent sign (%) are comments. LaTeX will
% not process those lines. Similarly, everything after a percent
% sign in a line is considered a comment. To produce a percent sign
% in the output, write \% (backslash followed by the percent sign).
% ==================================================================
% Usage instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The file is heavily commented so that you know what the various
% commands do. Feel free to remove any comments you don't need from
% your own copy. When redistributing the example thesis file, please
% retain all the comments for the benefit of other thesis writers!
% ==================================================================
% Compilation instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use pdflatex to compile! Input images are expected as PDF files.
% Example compilation:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You need to run pdflatex multiple times so that all the cross-references
% are fixed. pdflatex will tell you if you need to re-run it (a warning
% will be issued)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Compilation has been tested to work in ukk.cs.hut.fi and kosh.hut.fi
% - if you have problems of missing .sty -files, then the local LaTeX
% environment does not have all the required packages installed.
% For example, when compiling in vipunen.hut.fi, you get an error that
% tikz.sty is missing - in this case you must either compile somewhere
% else, or you cannot use TikZ graphics in your thesis and must therefore
% remove or comment out the tikz package and all the tikz definitions.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% General information
% ==================================================================
% Package documentation:
%
% The comments often refer to package documentation. (Almost) all LaTeX
% packages have documentation accompanying them, so you can read the
% package documentation for further information. When a package 'xxx' is
% installed to your local LaTeX environment (the document compiles
% when you have \usepackage{xxx} and LaTeX does not complain), you can
% find the documentation somewhere in the local LaTeX texmf directory
% hierarchy. In ukk.cs.hut.fi, this is /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist,
% and the documentation for the titlesec package (for example) can be
% found at /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/titlesec/titlesec.pdf.
% Most often the documentation is located as a PDF file in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xxx, where xxx is the package name;
% however, documentation for TikZ is in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf
% (this is because TikZ is a front-end for PGF, which is meant to be a
% generic portable graphics format for LaTeX).
% You can try to look for the package manual using the ``find'' shell
% command in Linux machines; the find databases are up-to-date at least
% in ukk.cs.hut.fi. Just type ``find xxx'', where xxx is the package
% name, and you should find a documentation file.
% Note that in some packages, the documentation is in the DVI file
% format. In this case, you can copy the DVI file to your home directory,
% and convert it to PDF with the dvipdfm command (or you can read the
% DVI file directly with a DVI viewer).
%
% If you can't find the documentation for a package, just try Googling
% for ``latex packagename''; most often you can get a direct link to the
% package manual in PDF format.

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% OT1 font encoding seems to work better than T1. Check the rendered
% PDF file to see if the fonts are encoded properly as vectors (instead

% Font selection
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The default LaTeX font is a very good font for rendering your

% accepted.
% If you, however, wish to spicen up your thesis, you can try out
% these font variants by uncommenting one of the following lines
% (or by finding another font package). The fonts shown here are
% all fonts that you could use in your thesis (not too silly).
% Changing the font causes the layouts to shift a bit; you many
% need to manually adjust some layouts. Check the warning messages
% LaTeX gives you.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% To find another font, check out the font catalogue from
% http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/mathfonts.html
% This link points to the list of fonts that support maths, but
% that's a fairly important point for master's theses.

A dissertation or thesis is a document submitted in support of candidature
for a degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and
findings. In some countries/universities, the word thesis or a cognate is used
as part of a bachelor's or master's course, while dissertation is normally
applied to a doctorate, whilst, in others, the reverse is true.

\fixme{Abstract text goes here (and this is an example how to use fixme).}
Fixme is a command that helps you identify parts of your thesis that still
require some work. When compiled in the custom \texttt{mydraft} mode, text
parts tagged with fixmes are shown in bold and with fixme tags around them. When
compiled in normal mode, the fixme-tagged text is shown normally (without
special formatting). The draft mode also causes the ``Draft'' text to appear on
the front page, alongside with the document compilation date. The custom
\texttt{mydraft} mode is selected by the \texttt{mydraft} option given for the
package \texttt{aalto-thesis}, near the top of the \texttt{thesis-example.tex}
file.

The thesis example file (\texttt{thesis-example.tex}), all the chapter content
files (\texttt{1introduction.tex} and so on), and the Aalto style file
(\texttt{aalto-thesis.sty}) are commented with explanations on how the Aalto
thesis works. The files also contain some examples on how to customize various
details of the thesis layout, and of course the example text works as an
example in itself. Please read the comments and the example text; that should
get you well on your way!}

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:intro}

This is my master's thesis, and I am very proud of it. Of course,
when I write my \emph{real} master's thesis, I will not use the
singular pronoun \emph{I}, but rather try to avoid referring to myself
and speak of the research \emph{we} have conducted---I rarely work
alone, after all. Yet, both \emph{I} and \emph{we} are correct, and
it depends on the instructor and the supervisor (of course from you,
too), which one they would prefer. Anyway, the tense should be active,
and passive sentenses should be avoided (especially, writing sentences
where the subject is presented with by preposition), so often you
cannot avoid choosing between the pronouns. Life is strange, but there
you have it.

By the way, the preferred order of writing your master's thesis is
about the same as the outline of the thesis: you first discover your
problem and write about that, then you find out what methods you
should use and write about that. Then you do your implementation, and
document that, and so on. However, the abstract and introduction are
often easiest to write last. This is because these really cover the
entire thesis, and there is no way you could know what to put in your
abstract before you have actually done your implementation and
evaluation. Rarely anyone write the thesis from the beginning to the
end just one time, but the writing is more like process, where every
piece of text is written at least twice. Be also prepared to delete
your own text. In the first phase, you can hide it into comments that
are started with \% but during the writing, the many comments should be
visible for your helpers, the instructor and supervisor.

The introduction in itself is rarely very long; two to five pages often
suffice.


\section{Problem statement}

Undergraduate students studying technical subjects do not consider typography
very interesting these days, and therefore the typographical quality of many
theses is unacceptably low.
We plan to rectify this situation somewhat by providing a decent-quality
example thesis outline for students.
We expect that the typographical quality of the master's theses will
dramatically increase as the new thesis outline is taken into use.

\section{Helpful hints}

Read the information from the university master's thesis
pages~\cite{ThesisInstructions} before starting the thesis. You
should also go through the thesis grading
instructions~\cite{ThesisGrading} together with your instructor and/or
supervisor in the beginning of your work.

\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{section:structure}

You should use transition in your text, meaning that you should help
the reader follow the thesis outline. Here, you tell what will be in
each chapter of your thesis.

\chapter{Background}
\label{chapter:background}

This chapter introduces different core logging methods and the coring process. 
Magnetic susceptibility measurements are discussed in dept.

\section{Core Logging}

Diamond drilling is commonly used method used for gaining core samples. It is expensive but highly
mobile and easy to prepare method. Diamond drill has an inner tube that collects the core and it can 
usually  hold a core lenght of 1,5 to 3 meteres. When the inner tube is filled with rock it is brought
back to surface with wires. Diamond drilling is slow on very hard rocks and collecting a whole core
sample on soft stones can prove to be a challenge. Rotary Drilling is cheaper and faster than diamond
drilling but it does not give a core to be examined later and can only be used for making bore holes
for well logging.\cite{Peters1987}

After core has been extracted from the rock it is quickly given first analysis by geologist with 
hand held lens or microscopes to guide the drilling process before more time consuming studies. 
Next the core is divided into practical lenghts and split into two
sections either by mechanical splitter, chisel or diamond saw. Half is taken for geological further
logging and the other one is stored for metallurgy and assay. Some of the core may be left whole
for geomechanical studies and split later. In laboratory the core is examined for major 
stuctures and lithological zone. Then it will be analysed and sampled. The sampling resoultion 
is nontrivial because it is time consuming and high resolution results in longer feedback time.\cite{Peters1987}

There are two kinds of core analysis methods, destructive and nondestructive. In destructive methods
are irreversible as it effects the structure of the core sampled and limits the methods that can be used
afterwards. Nondestructive methods do not affect the struckture of the core so the do not limit the 
analyses that can be conducted after them. Nondesctuctive methods usually provide good oversight of the
sample before more accurate desctrucktive methods.

'Wet' analysis is the most traditional of analysis methods. It is destructive as core is sampled and 
ground into fine powder. %TODO erilaiset wet analysis methodit tähän kirjasta!

Old X-ray methods used to be destructive \cite{Croudace2006} but newer methods for 
example ITRAX \cite{Croudace2006} are not. ITRAX is half core analysis scanner where core half is 
driven by a motor through an X-ray beam and then optical and X-radiographic values are recorded. 
X-ray beam is intensively focused through a flat capillary waveguide to irradiate the core half. 
This provides resolution up to 200 $\mu$m.%tätä vielä tarkemmin

\section{Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements}

Magnetic susceptibility is by definition magnetization divided by the field it is applied with.
Mathematically it can be expressed as  $\kappa$ that can be aguired by dividing induced magnetization 
per volume unit of measured sample (M) with applied magnetic field intensity (H)\cite{Lascu2009}:
\begin{equation}
$\kappa$ = $\frac{M}{H}$
\end{equation}
$\kappa$ has no dimensions since M and H have the same unit A/m. However if we know density of the 
material($\rho$) we may calculate mass specific magnetic susceptibility with following\cite{Lascu2009}:
\begin{equation}
$\chi$ = $\frac{\kappa}{\rho}$
\end{equation}
All substances may be categorised by their magnetic properties. Ferromagnetic minerals remember 
magnetic field that was applied on them by being able to contain a magnetic remnance. Good examples of 
ferromagnets are oxides such as magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), hematite (Fe$_2$O$_3$) and sulfides like pyrrhotite (Fe$_7$S$_8$) and greigite (Fe$_3$S$_4$). Ferromagnets have strongly 
positive magnetic susceptibility. Paramagnetic materials allow only weak interaction between metal atoms. Their
magnetic susceptibility is weakly positive. Paramagnetic minerals include Fe-Ti oxides (illmenite), Fe-Mn carbonates 
(siderite, rhodochrosite) and Fe sulfides (e.g. pyrite). Dimagnetic substances posses negative magnezitation when 
they are applied a weak magnetic field. They are minerals that do not contain iron, ogranic materials and artificial 
materials such as polyethylene and polycarbonates. According to Lascu\cite{Lascu2009}  dimagnetic materials are 
especially important because paleolimnology workers sometimes mistake errors caused by dimagnetic materials to be 
caused by errors in the instruments. \cite{Lascu2009}

It helps us understand how reservoirs filled with hydrocarbons (gases, oil) are formed.
Reservoirs are complex three-dimensional strucktures filled with pores.

The problem must have some background, otherwise it is not
interesting. You can explain the background here. Probably you should
change the title to something that describes more the content of this
chapter. Background consists of information that help other masters of
the same degree program to understand the rest of the thesis.

Transitions mentioned in Section~\ref{section:structure} are used also
in the chapters and sections. For example, next in this chapter we
tell how to use English language, how to find and refer to sources,
and enlight different ways to include graphics in the thesis.

\section{Language and Structure}

Moreover, the transitions are also used in the paragraph and the
sentence level meaning that all the text is linked together. For example,
the word ``moreover'' here is one way, but of course you should use
variation in the text. Examples of transitional devices (words) and
their use can be found from writing guides, e.g. from the Online
Writing Lab
(OWL)\footnote{http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/574/02/} of
Purdue University or Strunk's Elements of
Style\footnote{http://www.bartleby.com/141/}. Remember that footnotes
are additional information, and they are seldom used. If you refer to a source, you do no
not use footnote. The right command for the references is \emph{cite}.

The language used in the thesis should be technical (or
scientifical). For example, the abreviations aren't used but all them
are written open (i.e. ``are not''). Since the content itself is often
hard to understand (and explain), the sentences should not be very
long, use complex language with several examples embedded in the same
sentence, and, also, seldom used words and weird euphemism or paraphrases
can make the sentence hard to follow and to read it with only one
time, and making everything even harder to understand all this without
any punctuation marks makes the instructor cry and finally after
trying to correct the language, you will get boomerang, and everyone's
time has just been wasted.

Please use proofreaders before sending even your unfinished version to
the instructor and/or supervisor. You will get better comments when
they do not need first proofread your text. Moreover, they can
consentrate to the content better if the language and spelling
mistakes are not distracting the reading. Several editors have their
own proofreading tools, e.g. ispell in emacs. You can also use
Microsoft Word to proofread your thesis: it can correct also some
grammatical errors and not just misspelled words.

Note also that if you have a section or a subsection, you have to have
at least two of them, or otherwise the section or subsection title is
unnecessary. Same with the paragraphs an: you should not have sections
with only one paragraphe, and single sentence paragraph. Furthermore,
always write some text after the title before the next level title.

\section{Finding and referring to sources}

Never ever copy anything into your theses from somebody else's text
(nor your own previously published text). Never. Not even for starting
point to be rewritten later. The risk is that you forgot the copied
text to your thesis and end up to be accused of plagiarism. Plagiarism
is a serious crime in studies and science and can ruin your career
even its beginning. To repeate: never cut and paste text into your
thesis!

\subsection{Finding sources}

All work is based on someone else's work. You should find the relevant
sources of your field and choose the best of them. Also, you should
refer to the original source where a fact has been mentioned first
time. Remember source evaluation (criticism) with all sources you
find.

Good starting points for finding references in computer science are:
\begin{itemize}
% You can use this command to set the items in the list closer to each other
% (ITEM SEParation, the vertical space between the list items)
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Nelli Portal (Aalto Library): \url{http://www.nelliportaali.fi}
\item ACM Digital library: \url{http://portal.acm.org/}
\item IEEExplore: \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org}
\item ScienceDirect: \url{http://www.sciencedirect.com/}
\item \ldots although Google Scholar (\url{http://scholar.google.com/}) will
find links to most of the articles from the abovementioned sources, if you
search from within the university network
\end{itemize}

Some of the publishers do not offer all the text of the articles
freely, but the library has agreed on the rights to use the whole
text. Thus, you should sometimes use computers in the domain of the
university in order to get the full text. Sometimes the Nelli Portal
can also help getting the whole article instead of just the abstract.
The library has also brief instrucions how to find
information~\cite{howfindinfo}.

Instead of normal Google, use Google Scholar
(\url{http://scholar.google.fi/}). It finds academic publications whereas
normal Google find too much commercial advertisements or otherwise
biased information. Wikipedia articles should be referred to in the master
thesis only very, very seldomly. You can use Wikipedia for understanding
some basics and finding more sources, but often you cannot be sure if
the article is correct and unbiased.

One important part of the sources that you have found is the reference
list. This way you can find the original sources that all the other
research of the field refer. Often you can also find more information
with the name of the researchers that are often referred in the
articles.

\subsection{Referring to sources}

The main point in referring to sources is to separate your own
thinking and text from that of others. Facts of the research area can
be given without reference, but otherwise you should refer to
sources. This means two things: marking the source in the text where
it has been used, and listing the sources usually in the end of the
thesis in a way that help the reader to find the original source.

There are several bibliography styles, meaning how to form the
bibliography in the end of the thesis. Aalto's library has good
instructions for many styles~\cite{bibinstructions}. You should ask
from your supervisor or instructors which style you should use. This
thesis template uses the number style that is often used in software
engineering. The other style also used in the CS field,
e.g. usability, is the Harvard style where instead of numbers, the
reference is marked into the text with author's name and publishing
year. Other areas use also many other styles for making the lists and
marking the references.

In addition to the list in the end of the thesis, you have to mark the
source in the text where the source is used. There are three places
for the reference: in a sentence before the period, in the end of a
sentence after the period, or in the end of a paragraph. All of them
have different meaning. The main point is that first you paraphrase
the source using your own words and then mark the source. Next, we
give short examples that are marked with \emph{emphasised text}.

\emph{Haapasalo~\cite{HaapasaloThesis} researched database algorithms
  that allows use of previous versions of the content stored in the
  database.} This kind of marking means that this paragraph (or until
the next reference is given) is based on the source mentioned in the
beginning. Giving the source you should use only the family name of
the first author of the article, and not give any hints about what is
the type of the article that is referred.

\emph{B+-trees offers one way to index data that is stored in to a
  database. Multiversion B+-trees (MVBT) offer also a way to restore
  the data from previous versions of the database. Concurrent MVBT
  allows many simultaneous updates to the database that is was not
  possible with MVBT.~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}} When the marking is
after the period, the reference is retrospective: all the paragraph
(or after previous reference marking) is based on the source given in
its end. If the content is very broad, you can start with saying
\emph{According to Haapasalo}, then continue referring the source with
several separate sentences, and in the end put the marking of your
source \emph{ that shows that CMVBT are the
  best. ~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}}.

If your paragraph has several sources, the above mentioned styles are
not proper. The reader of your thesis cannot know which of your
sources give which of the statements. In this case, it is better to
use more finegraded refering where the reference markings that are
embedded in the sentences. For example, \emph{the multiversion B+-tree
  (MVBT) index of Becker et al.~\cite{becker:1996:mvbt} allows database
  users to query old versions of the database, but the index is not
  transactional.
  It's successor, the transactional MBVT (TMVBT), allows a single transaction
  running in its own thread or process to update the database concurrently
  with other transactions that only read the
  database~\cite{haapasalo:2009:tmvbt}.
  Further development, titled the concurrent MBVT (CMVBT),
  allows several transactions to perform updates to the database at the same
  time~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}}.
  Here, the references are marked before
  the period in the sentences where they are used.

Finally, direct quotes are allowed. However, often you should avoid
them since they do not usually fit in to your text very well. Using
direct quotes has two tricks: quotation marks and the source. \emph{
  ``Even though deletions in a multiversion index must not physically
  delete the history of the data items, queries and range scans can
  become more efficient, if the leaf pages of the index structure are
  merged to retain optimality.''~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}} Quotes are
hard to make neatly since you should use only as much as needed
without changing the text. Moreover, you often do not really
understand what the author has mentioned with his wordings if you
cannot write the same with your own words. Remember also that never
cut and paste anything without marking the quotation marks right away,
and in general, never cut and paste anything at all!

Sometimes getting the original source can be almost impossible. In an
extremely desperate situation, you can refer with structure \emph{mr
  X~[\ldots] according to ms Y~[\ldots] defined that}, if you find a
source that refers to the original source. Note also that the
reference marking is never used as sentence element (example of how
\textbf{not} to do it: \emph{\cite{HaapasaloThesis} describes
an optimal algorithm for indexing multiversiond databases.}).
