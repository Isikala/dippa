\chapter{Background}
\label{chapter:background}

This chapter introduces different core logging methods and the coring process. 
Magnetic susceptibility measurements are discussed in dept.

\section{Core Logging Process}

Diamond drilling is commonly used method used for gaining core samples. It is expensive but highly
mobile and easy to prepare method. Diamond drill has an inner tube that collects the core and it can 
usually  hold a core length of 1,5 to 3 meters. When the inner tube is filled with rock it is brought
back to surface with wires. Diamond drilling is slow on very hard rocks and collecting a whole core
sample on soft stones can prove to be a challenge. Rotary Drilling is cheaper and faster than diamond
drilling but it does not give a core to be examined later and can only be used for making bore holes
for well logging.\cite{Peters1987}

%tähän kuva timanttiporasta

After core has been extracted from the rock it is quickly given first analysis by geologist with 
hand held lens or microscopes to guide the drilling process before more time consuming studies. 
Next the core is divided into practical lenghts and split into two
sections either by mechanical splitter, chisel or diamond saw. Half is taken for geological further
logging and the other one is stored for metallurgy and assay. Some of the core may be left whole
for geomechanical studies and split later. In laboratory the core is examined for major 
structures and lithological zone. Then it will be analyzed and sampled. The sampling resultion 
is nontrivial because it is time consuming and high resolution results in longer feedback time.\cite{Peters1987}

There are two kinds of core analysis methods, destructive and nondestructive. In destructive methods
are irreversible as it effects the structure of the core sampled and limits the methods that can be used
afterwards. Nondestructive methods do not affect the strukture of the core so the do not limit the 
analyses that can be conducted after them. Nondestructive methods usually provide good oversight of the
sample before more accurate destructive methods.

'Wet' analysis is the most traditional of analysis methods. It is destructive as core is sampled and 
ground into fine powder. %TODO erilaiset wet analysis methodit tähän kirjasta!

Old X-ray methods used to be destructive \cite{Croudace2006} but newer methods for 
example one used in ITRAX \cite{Croudace2006} are not. ITRAX is half core analysis scanner where core half is 
driven by a motor through an X-ray beam and then optical and X-radiographic values are recorded. 
X-ray beam is intensively focused through a flat capillary waveguide to irradiate the core half. 
This provides resolution up to 200 $\mu$m.%tätä vielä tarkemmin ei kuitenkaan hirveen paljoa

\section{Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements}

Magnetic susceptibility is by definition magnetization divided by the field it is applied with.
Mathematically it can be expressed as  $\kappa$ that can be aguired by dividing induced magnetization 
per volume unit of measured sample (M) with applied magnetic field intensity (H)\cite{Lascu2009}:
\begin{equation}
$\kappa$ = $\frac{M}{H}$
\end{equation}
$\kappa$ has no dimensions since M and H have the same unit A/m. However if we know density of the 
material($\rho$) we may calculate mass specific magnetic susceptibility with following\cite{Lascu2009}:
\begin{equation}
$\chi$ = $\frac{\kappa}{\rho}$
\end{equation}
All substances may be categorised by their magnetic properties. Ferromagnetic minerals remember 
magnetic field that was applied on them by being able to contain a magnetic remnance. Good examples of 
ferromagnets are oxides such as magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), hematite (Fe$_2$O$_3$) and sulfides like pyrrhotite (Fe$_7$S$_8$) and greigite (Fe$_3$S$_4$). Ferromagnets have strongly 
positive magnetic susceptibility. Paramagnetic materials allow only weak interaction between metal atoms. Their
magnetic susceptibility is weakly positive. Paramagnetic minerals include Fe-Ti oxides (illmenite), Fe-Mn carbonates 
(siderite, rhodochrosite) and Fe sulfides (e.g. pyrite). Dimagnetic substances posses negative magnezitation when 
they are applied a weak magnetic field. They are minerals that do not contain iron, ogranic materials and artificial 
materials such as polyethylene and polycarbonates. According to Lascu\cite{Lascu2009}  dimagnetic materials are 
especially important because paleolimnology workers sometimes mistake errors caused by dimagnetic materials to be 
caused by errors in the instruments. \cite{Lascu2009}

There are many different methods to measure magnetic susceptibility. In paper\cite{Marcon2012} good overview of them
was made. Faraday's scale is good method for ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and dimagnetic materials. It's working 
principle is that when sample with magnetic moment is moved into a magnetic field the energy of the magnetic field
changes and a this causes a force on the specimen that can be measured. Guoy's scale works with the same principle 
as the Faraday's scale with the difference that is has homogeneous field instead of gradient one.  Guoy's scale has
accuracy of about 1 \% and sensitivity of 10^{-9}.\cite{Marcon2012}

%\begin{figure}[ht]

%    \caption{Faray's scale on the left and Guoy's scale on the right}
%    \label{fig:FaraGuoy}
%  \end{center}
%\end{figure}

According to the research\cite{Marcon2012} inductive method is popular in geological magnetic susceptibility
measurements. In inductive method there is two coil next to each other and harmonic currency is put through them
when sample is put into other coil it causes its inductance to change and the difference in inductances indicates
the magnetic susceptibility of the specimen.\cite{Marcon2012}             

The superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) is extremely sensitive sensor for magnetic fluids
\cite{Marcon2012}. It is made of two parallel Josepson Junction and requires extremely low temperatures
working temperature 4.2K for example in liquid helium\cite{Marcon2012}. It's extreme accuracy is based on measuring 
changes one flux quantum related magnetic fields\cite{Marcon2012}.

%    \caption{Josepson Junction}
%    \label{fig:FaraGuoy}
%  \end{center}
%\end{figure}

Final methods for magnetic susceptibility discussed in the research\cite{Marcon2012} were couple MR(Magnetic
resonance) methods. First of them was a method that uses resonant frequency discontinuity between two materials
that each have observable MR signal. Second method assumes uniform susceptibility distribution in samples or a
well-defined geometric shape. Second method was said to have many practical problems. Third method was to examine
a specimen with weakly magnetic field in a static magnetic field. This was said to have notable distortion in the 
magnetic field. This third method was said to be viable even for materials that do not provide any MR signals.
The susceptibility is calculated from reaction field in this method.\cite{Marcon2012}

Magnetic susceptibility can be measured easily from both whole core and half core samples. The three most popular 
measurement apparatus types for continious measurements are loop sensors, point sensors and sample sensors. Next
these three sensor types will be introduced.

%kuva erilaisista sensoreista

Loop sensors are loop like systems and they measure the magnetic susceptibility by the change in magnetic flux when full core is moved through them. 
The best performance is acquired when loop sensor has radius close to the core radius. According to the 
research\cite{Nowaczyk2001}: it is also important to consider the results at the begging of core section and at the
end of it. The core affects the magnetic field of the coil before it enters it and the air behind the core also has 
an effect of the readings at the end of the core section. In the research\cite{Nowaczyk2001}: a way to fix this 
error was proposed. Following core parts may be attached together so there is no gap between them. This might be
problematic because sometimes core parts have caps in their both ends thus preventing this. Other method proposed
in this research\cite{Nowaczyk2001}: was to start logging well before the core and continue the logging after the
core has passed the sensor. Good results may be acquired by superimposing the core logs after the previous core with
core log of the following in respect to a common dept scale.
core part . This would leave only small part of the measurement at the beginning and at
end of the core sample air-biased \cite{Nowaczyk2001}:. In this method it is important that the common dept scale
of the cores is correct. Otherwise artificial peaks may be noted in measurements\cite{Nowaczyk2001}:. Other source
for errors in loop sensors is drifting. When sensor is zeroed it loses its calibration over time and starts to 
show readings even on air. This effect may be removed by starting measurements before core reaches the sensors
sensitivity volume and continuing to take readings after the core has passed the sensor. By comparing the readings
before and after the core and fitting them with linear regression the error may be averaged over the core and the 
error may be removed. This should be done before superimposing the readings. Also deconvolution was introduced in
the research\cite{Nowaczyk2001}: but it was said to have only limited applicability.

Point sensors perform better when used on half core samples. The measurements
are taken on straight surface cut of the core taking the measurement
from round side of the core half causes some error in readings. Point
sensors are also highly sensitive to the distance they are from the object. It
is important to keep the sensor adjacent to the core for best possible result.
Homogeneousness also affects the effectiveness of point sensor measurement.
Since the sensor takes readings only from very small area core plugs with
very high heterogeneity might result in biased readings. One of the advantages
of using point sensor is that the sampling points may be selected so
that damaged parts of the core may be avoided. Also when taking point sensor
readings the errors in the end of the core plug discussed in the previous
chapter are not problematic in this measurement method.\cite{Nowaczyk2001}

Third method widely used in measuring magnetic susceptibility is measurement
of discrete samples of the core. A small sample is cut from the
core and placed into measurement device. According to the research\cite{Nowaczyk2001} this
is especially good when measuring susceptibility changes in cores that have
very low susceptibility values. This method gives most accurate results from
the three. It is also the slowest because samples must be cut from the core
being measured.\cite{Nowaczyk2001}
